## Agent Guidelines

When working on this project, agents should:

1.  **Check Policy First**: Always refer to `ai-grader-policy` or `docs/architecture-policy.md` before architectural decisions.
2.  **Use Design System**: Follow colors and fonts defined in `ui-ux-guide.md` and `globals.css`.
3.  **Feature-First**: Place business logic in `features/` directory, not `components/`.
